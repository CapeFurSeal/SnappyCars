# SnappyCars
An example application created in Swift 4 which integrates and showcases the SnappCar REST API using a MVP design pattern. This demonstrates one of the many usages of the UITableViewDataSourcePrefetching delegate. 
This project uses third party frameworks such as Alamofire "I used this framework because it is the most popular networking library", Object Mapper "To avoid having to map of objects by myself due to time constraints" and Kingfisher "For the awesome parsing of image url's"
